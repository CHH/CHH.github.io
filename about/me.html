<p>I <strong>build</strong> software throwing in PHP, Go, JavaScript and Shell
    scripts into the mix. I <strong>design</strong> and <strong>build</strong> User Interfaces with a diverse set
    of devices in mind,
    <strong>manage</strong> projects and occasionally do the one or
    other Ops thing with SmartOS, Amazon Web Services or Puppet.
</p>

<p>I created open source tools and libraries to
    <a href='https://github.com/CHH/php-build'>make it easy to run multiple versions of PHP side by side</a>,
    to <a href='https://github.com/CHH/pipe'>manage front end assets</a>
    and <a href='https://github.com/CHH/bob'>automate projects</a>.
    I&#8217;m also a contributor to open source projects like
    <a href='http://getcomposer.org'>Composer</a>
    or <a href='http://stackphp.com'>Stack</a>.
</p>

<p>I spend most of my time trying to make the life of other PHP programmers more joyful through Open Source, but I also know some <em>Ruby</em>, know my way around <em>Rails</em>, and think that <em>Go</em> is an awesome language for developing systems and services.</p>
<p>When away from the computer I'm a photographer, a cyclist and serving in the local volunteer fire company.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Designers should be able to code.</strong> Being able to code
            lets Designers prototype ideas longer &mdash; which leads to better thought
            out ideas, and thus to better products.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Designing in the browser is superior to designing in Photoshop.</strong>
            A <em>drawing</em> of a web site is never able to communicate the full
            breadth of possible interactions, and is a far cry from the result.</li>
        <li>
            Tell people <strong>what</strong> to do and <strong>why</strong>
            &mdash;not <strong>how</strong>.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Involving engineering as early in the design process as possible
            yields the best results.</strong> Programmers often have
            valuable feedback, and often are as &#8220;design-minded&#8221; as
            people who call themselves Designers.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Project managers are not able to tell the future.</strong>
            processes should deal well with the changing nature of reality.</li>
