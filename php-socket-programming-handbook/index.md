It's an article about the basics of socket programming in PHP, and how to get on
the right track. I thought this was interesting.

Then I thought back, how I struggled with this concept when I started out
programming, nearly 10 years ago.

1. There are two ways to do this in PHP. And you have to discover the pleasant
   way yourself (it's not the obvious one).
2. You need to know some networking terminology to understand it properly, which is often omitted
   in programming books. Especially in books about programming in PHP.
3. The PHP manual is often aweful to read. Good, simple, and tweakable examples are hard to come by.
4. We are used to the fact that PHP starts from fresh memory on each request,
   servers are so entirely different.

## So this sucks. Let's fix this.

What if you had a book, that…

1. …_tells you the right way_ to approach socket programming in PHP.
2. …_starts bottom up,_ beginning with the basic networking terminology.
3. …_provides simple, tweakable examples,_ which you can use as a base for your
   stuff.
4. …_and has someone who is available for all your questions_, if you are stuck.
