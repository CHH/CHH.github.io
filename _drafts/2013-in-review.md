With 2013 nearly at its end, let's look back.

# Life

# Blog

2013 was a good year for my blog, all in all.

* **7** posts published
* **3** draft posts still in the queue
* **21355** visits with **16401** unique visitors. This is **30\.11%** less[^1] than in 2012. 

The most popular posts of 2013:

1. [PHP Socket Programming done the Right Way](/2012/07/24/php-socket-programming/) with 19091 visits
2. [Closure Object Binding in PHP 5.4](/2011/10/26/closure-object-binding-in-php-54/) with 1727 visits
3. [PHP Unix Programming](/2012/02/01/php-unix-programming/) with 1705 visits

[^1]: This is largely because in 2013 I've stopped syndicating my posts to Hacker News, because the generated traffic isn't worth much. I've observed much higher bounce rate and less visit duration for vistors coming from HackerNews.
