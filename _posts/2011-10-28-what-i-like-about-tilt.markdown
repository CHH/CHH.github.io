title: What I like about Tilt

[Tilt](http://tiltrb.com) is a templating *library* for **Ruby**. It's not an
engine, but kind of an aggregator for templating engines and provides
adapters to Erubis, Markdown and even for LESS and SASS. It's kind of
a "Meta" Templating Engine. Here is what I like about it.

## Democrizing View Templates

Tilt supports many templating engines and you can choose the one you
like the most. Want to use Markdown instead of Textile? Just use a
`.markdown` file instead of a `.textile`. Or need some templates on the
client side too? Use a JST or Mustache engine. The user can choose what
*he/she* likes to use, or choose the *best* tool for the job.

## Ideal for Frameworks

Tilt is an ideal library for frameworks. Frameworks can provide a great
set of options for their users, and at the same time they don't have to
reinvent the wheel for themselves.
