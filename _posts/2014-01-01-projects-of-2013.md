title: Interesting Projects of 2013
---
Continuing in the series of my 2013 review posts, I have now worked
through all the projects I starred for inspiration and awesomeness.
For your enjoyment, in no particular order.

# [adobe-webplatform/balance-text](https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/balance-text)

A jQuery plugin which implements a `text-wrap: balanced` mode for text
wrapping. This text mode produces text which is rendered so the amount
of text on each line is about the same. They already proposed this as an
addition to CSS3, but I currently didn't find any reports on the
proposal's status.

I really like how Adobe starts to learn how to apply itself on the web.
With their vast experience with typography, animation and 
layout they bring to the table, they could improve a lot in web publishing.

# [aws/aws-sdk-php](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php)

2013 finally brought much needed love to the PHP SDK for Amazon Web
Services. The new version breaks with all backwards compatibility with
the 1.x series, but features PSR-0 compatibility, much saner configuration
handling, and a library built with modern PHP and the solid foundations
provided by the [Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org) toolkit.

# [igorw/middleware](https://github.com/igorw/middleware)

This project isn't really something you would use in production, but 
the an interesting concept about using Symfony's `HttpKernelInterface` for
creating and composing reusable HTTP middleware components.
Here is the accompanying blog post "[HttpKernel Middlewares](https://igor.io/2013/02/02/http-kernel-middlewares.html)"
by [Igor Wiedler][].

This was very important because it kicked of a major new movement in 2013: The
[Stack][] project (disclaimer: I'm part of it).

[Stack]: http://stackphp.com

# [madrobby/keymaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster)

Thomas Fuchs (Scriptaculous, Zepto) did it again. Keymaster is a tiny library for adding
keyboard shortcuts to your web apps and works without jQuery and in all
browsers (IE6+, Safari, Firefox and Chrome).

# [progrium/dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku)

Dokku is a simple implementation of a Heroku like service which you can
host on your own machines. It provides compatibility with Heroku
buildpacks, `git push` deployment and is built with a couple hundred
lines of Shell code on top of [Docker](http://docker.io).

# [Automattic/\_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)

"\_s" or also called "[Underscores](http://underscores.me)" is a very minimalistic
, HTML5 based starter theme for WordPress by Automattic (the company 
behind [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com),
[Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) and more). I've used this recently to
build a custom theme for a WordPress project, and I must say this is
really the most sane way to get into developing WordPress themes.

# [phpcr/phpcr](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr)

PHPCR is an API for working with a persistent tree of content nodes,
which is the awful part of implementing a content management system.
PHPCR provides many drivers beneath a common API which allows it to work
with relational databases and document oriented databases.

This is really an empowering innovation for building content management
systems. With PHPCR you can develop a content management system and
focus on the user experience, workflows, etc. without having to think
about the complex foundations like persistence of a tree structure, versioning
of content or database compatibility.

I think in 2014 we will see more interesting content management systems
built in PHP and based on PHPCR, with better user experiences, new ideas, as well as more code sharing among the familiar ones.
 
# [rom-rb/rom](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom)

ROM stands for _Ruby Object Mapper_ and is an implementation of the
Data Mapper Pattern for Ruby. The awesome thing is how easy ROM is to
use. It's powered by loosely coupled libraries which do one thing well
and by a powerful implementation of a relational algebra called "Axiom"
which provides an awesome query language.
