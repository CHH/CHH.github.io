Over the past half year I've noticed that issues and pull requests start
piling up and are taking often even weeks to resolve on the
[php-build][] project. Due to this I've decided to form the php-build
Core Team.

Let's welcome [Loïc Frering](https://github.com/loicfrering) and [Rogerio Prado de Jesus](https://github.com/rogeriopradoj) with a warm hug as the two new members of the core team!

__Loïc Frering__ was _the_ first contributor to php-build, and it
wouldn't power the PHP support of Travis CI without him! He is the glue between
php-build and Travis CI.

__Rogerio Prado de Jesus__ practically contributed nearly every single one of the definitions
for PHP versions of the last year and the necessary pieces to test
php-build on Travis CI.

I want also to take this chance to thank all past [contributors](https://github.com/CHH/php-build/graphs/contributors) who donate their time to php-build! __You are awesome!__

## What about me?

I will still try to be involved in the big decisions in the project, but
from now on Loïc and Rogerio have the major say in the development.

This hopefully means that new PHP versions will be available much faster in php-build, because they
can be released without a need for me. This should also mean that the quality of
[php-build][] will increase, and on
[other](https://github.com/CHH/pipe) [projects](https://github.com/CHH/heroku-buildpack-php) as well.
