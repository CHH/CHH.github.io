I was quite happy how the responsive redesign of this site turned out,
but nevertheless there were some things which didn't feel right. The
homepage was just a mess, because it wanted to be too many things at
once.

* Focussed the homepage on the blog and moved the rest to
  [About me](/about/me).
* New sidebar and navigation (hint hint, try it on your phone)
* Tweaked typography a bit and used the excellent Adelle for
  page headlines again.

Please tell me what you think in the [comments](/2013/10/15/site-design-tweaks/#comments).
