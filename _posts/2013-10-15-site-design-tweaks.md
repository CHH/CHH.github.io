I was quite happy how the responsive redesign of this site turned out.
But nevertheless there were some things which didn't feel right. The
homepage wanted to be too many things at once. That made it a mess.

So I did these changes:

* Focused the homepage on the blog and moved the rest to
  [About me](/about/me).
* New sidebar and navigation (try it on your phone)
* Tweaked typography a bit and used the excellent Adelle for
  page headlines again.

Please tell me what you think in the [comments](/2013/10/15/site-design-tweaks/#comments).
