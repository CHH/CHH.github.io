title: The PHP Socket Programming Handbook is launching
tags: [PSA]
---
It's finally happening. I'm launching the [PHP Socket Programming Handbook](/php-socket-programming-handbook/).

It's been long in the works, mostly due to me starting a business (and all that comes with that).

I'm about to launch it mid next week. [Subscribe now](/php-socket-programming-handbook/subscribe/?icn=phpsphb&ici=post20140730_button) to get __10â‚¬ off the launch price__ at checkout and get early access to the book on _Sunday afternoon (CEST)_. _That's three days before anyone else gets it._
