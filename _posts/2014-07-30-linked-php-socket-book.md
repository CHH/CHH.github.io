Since 2012 lots of people have read [this blog post]({% post_url 2012-07-24-php-socket-programming %})
about socket programming. It's the most read post on this blog, year after year.
It even got translated into two other languages than
English. Many people are sending me questions by email.

Now I'm writing a little book, to make a more comprehensive look at
socket programming in PHP.

The book will launch in __Fall 2014.__ You can subscribe now to my mailing list
