title: We Power Users are going to be the 80 percent

excerpt: >
    Recent OS releases follow some kind of trend: 
    they all try to make the desktop more usable 
    for normal users. But with the rapid adoption 
    of tablets, the power users will be left as the 
    80 percent who use desktops at all.

The recent announcement that all Apps distributed through the Mac App
Store must run in a sandbox beginning with March 2012 has had a huge 
echo in the tech world. I think it's not a big deal though, because
Microsoft is restricting API access for all apps distributed through
their store too with Windows 8.

It marks a trend: everyone is trying to make their desktop operating
systems more approachable for normal users. Apple did it with Lion and
the Mac App Store, Microsoft is doing it with Windows 8, and Canonical
does it with Ubuntu.

## The Desktop is dead &mdash; for most People

Though what got me thinking is, that they're bringing
these paradigms of mobile operating systems to the desktop, but fail
to see, that the _only_ ones who are going to be left using PCs are
we **Power Users**.

Don't get me wrong: I like when things are simple, and Just
Work&trade;.

Everyone else _will_ use tablets, because normal users can now do everything 
on a tablet, that they would have traditionally done on a computer (and
with less maintenance and hassle by the way).

Let's face it. I say **80%** of people use a computer to do exactly
these things:

 * Web Browsing
 * Email
 * Simple Office Work (making simple printouts, presentations)
 * Hear music, see videos

And they can do these things on a tablet without

 * worrying about malware
 * worrying about hardware (including which hardware to buy)
 * worrying about software and operating systems
 * needing someone who maintains their system

So what's left, that we can **not** do on tablets (yet):

 * Building Software (Compiling, running interpreters)
 * Things which tablets simply don't have the horsepower to (animation,
   complex image editing, complex video processing, CAD)

Yeah, and that are exactly all Power User tasks.

(You _could_ now say, these could be all offloaded to servers and made
available to you on the tablet via remote access and the like &mdash; **but** if you
would ever have done these things in the cloud and your internet
is not so stable, then you would realize it's a pain in the butt. And
if you ever worked with infrastructure in the cloud, you would realize
it's not so easy as it seams.)

So the bottom line is:

Why do Microsoft and Apple (and recently also Canonical)
do not _embrace_ the Power Users on their **Desktop** OS, though we are
in the near future the 80% of their users?
