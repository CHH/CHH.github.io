After quite a bit of a pause, I'm starting with some little libs again.
First came [MustacheJsCompiler](https://github.com/CHH/MustacheJsCompiler)
and next up is [Stack Honeypot](https://github.com/CHH/stack-honeypot).

It's a port of the excellent [Rack::Honeypot](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/rack-honeypot) Rack middleware and tries to identify and block spam bot requests by inserting a hidden form field with an interesting name.
