        <p>I&#8217;m an expert PHP developer, throwing in Go, JavaScript and Shell
            scripts every now and then. I design and build User Interfaces with a diverse set 
            of devices in mind,
            manage projects and occasionally do the one or 
            other Ops thing with SmartOS, Amazon Web Services or Puppet.</p>

        <p>I created open source tools and libraries to 
            <a href='https://github.com/CHH/php-build'>make it easy to get the latest PHP</a>,
            to <a href='https://github.com/CHH/pipe'>manage front end assets</a> 
            and <a href='https://github.com/CHH/bob'>automate projects</a>. 
            I&#8217;m also a contributor to open source projects like 
            <a href='http://getcomposer.org'>Composer</a> 
            or <a href='http://stackphp.com'>Stack</a>. You can find 
            out more about me at <a href='https://github.com/CHH'>Github</a>.</p>

        <p>I believe:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Designers must be able to code.</strong> Being able to code
                let's Designers prototype ideas longer &mdash; which leads to better thought
                out ideas, and thus to better products.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Designing in the browser is superior to designing Photoshop.</strong>
                A <em>drawing</em> of a web site is never able to communicate the full 
                breadth of possible interactions, and is a far cry from the result.</li>
            <li>
                Tell people <strong>what</strong> to do and <strong>why</strong>
                &mdash;not <strong>how</strong>.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Involve engineering as early in the design process as possible 
                yields the best results.</strong> Programmers often have 
                valuable feedback, and often are as &#8220;design-minded&#8221; as 
                people who call themselves Designers.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Project managers are not able to tell the future.</strong>
                Development processes should be made for adapting to changing requirements.</li>
        </ul>
